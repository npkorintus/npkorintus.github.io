      <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).</p>
      <p>"Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.</p>
      <p>HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements" such as:</p>
      <ul id="element-list">
        <li><code>&lt;body&gt;</code></li>
        <li><code>&lt;main&gt;</code></li>
        <li><code>&lt;header&gt;</code></li>
        <li><code>&lt;section&gt;</code></li>
        <li><code>&lt;div&gt;</code></li>
      </ul>
      <p>and many others.</p>

      <h1 class="header">Basics</h1>
      <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.</p>
      <h3>So what is HTML?</h3>
      <p>HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.  For example, take the following line of content:</p>
      <p><code class="code-line">My cat is very grumpy</code></p>
      <p>If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags:</p>
      <p><code class="code-line">&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;</code></p>
      <p>The main parts of our element are as follows:</p>
      <ol id="html-elements">
        <li><strong>The opening tag:</strong> This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.</li>
        <li><strong>The closing tag:</strong> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.</li>
        <li><strong>The content:</strong> This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.</li>
        <li><strong>The element:</strong> The opening tag, the closing tag and the content together comprise the element.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Marking_up_text">
      <h1 class="header">Marking up text</h1>
      <p>This section will cover some of the essential HTML elements you'll use for marking up the text.</p>
      <h3>Headings</h3>
      <p>Heading elements allow you to specify that certain parts of your content are headings — or subheadings. In the same way that a book has the main title, chapter titles and subtitles, an HTML document can too. HTML contains 6 heading levels, <code>&lt;h1&gt; – &lt;h6&gt;</code>, although you'll commonly only use 3 to 4 at most:</p>
      <code class="code-block">1 | &lt;h1&gt;My main title&lt;/h1&gt;<br>2 | &lt;h2&gt;My top level heading&lt;/h2&gt;<br>3 | &lt;h3&gt;My subheading&lt;/h3&gt;<br>4 | &lt;h4&gt;My sub-subheading&lt;/h4&gt;</code>
        <h3>Paragraphs</h3>
        <p>As explained above, &lt;p&gt; elements are for containing paragraphs of text; you'll use these frequently when marking up regular text content:<p>
        <code class="code-line">&lt;p&gt;This is a single paragraph&lt;/p&gt;</code>
        <h3>Lists</h3>
        <p>A lot of the web's content is lists and HTML has special elements for these. Marking up lists always consist of at least 2 elements. The most common list types are ordered and unordered lists:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Unordered lists</strong> are for lists where the order of the items doesn't matter, such as a shopping list. These are wrapped in a <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> element.</li>
          <li><strong>Ordered lists</strong> are for lists where the order of the items does matter, such as a recipe. These are wrapped in an <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> element.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Each item inside the lists is put inside an <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> (list item) element.</p>
        <p>For example, if we wanted to turn the part of the following paragraph fragment into a list</p>
        <code class="code-line">1 | &lt;p&gt;At Mozilla, we’re a global community of technologists, thinkers, and builders working together ...&lt;/p&gt;</code>
        <p>We could modify the markup to this</p>
        <code class="code-block">1 | &lt;p&gt;At Mozilla, we’re a global community of&lt;/p&gt;<br>2 |<br>3 | &lt;ul&gt;<br>4 |   &lt;li&gt;technologists&lt;/li&gt;<br>5 |   &lt;li&gt;thinkers&lt;/li&gt;<br>6 |   &lt;li&gt;builders&lt;/li&gt;<br>7 | &lt;/ul&gt;<br>8 |<br>9 | &lt;p&gt;working together ... &lt;/p&gt;</code>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Links">
      <h1 class="header">Links</h1>
      <p>Links are very important — they are what makes the web a web! To add a link, we need to use a simple element — <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> — "a" being the short form for "anchor". To make text within your paragraph into a link, follow these steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Choose some text. We chose the text "Mozilla Manifesto".</li>
        <li>Wrap the text in an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element, as shown below:</li>
        <code class="code-line">1 | &lt;a&gt;Mozilla Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;</code>
        <li>Give the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element an <code>href</code> attribute, as shown below</li>
        <code class="code-line">2 | &lt;a href=""&gt;Mozilla Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;</code>
        <li>Fill in the value of this attribute with the web address that you want the link to link to:</li>
        <code class="code-line">3 | &lt;a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/" &gt;Mozilla Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;</code>
      </ol>
      <p>You might get unexpected results if you omit the <code>https://</code> or <code>http://</code> part, called the protocol, at the beginning of the web address. After making a link, click it to make sure it is sending you where you wanted it to.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Images">
      <h1 class="header">Images</h1>
      <p>Let's turn our attention to the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element again:</p>
      <code class="code-line">1 | &lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image"&gt;</code>
      <p>As we said before, it embeds an image into our page in the position it appears. It does this via the <code>src</code> (source) attribute, which contains the path to our image file.</p>
      <p>We have also included an <code>alt</code> (alternative) attribute. In this attribute, you specify descriptive text for users who cannot see the image, possibly because of the following reasons:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>They are visually impaired. Users with significant visual impairments often use tools called screen readers to read out the alt text to them.</li>
        <li>Something has gone wrong causing the image not to display. For example, try deliberately changing the path inside your <code>src</code> attribute to make it incorrect. If you save and reload the page, you should see something like this in place of the image:</li>
      </ol>
      <p><img alt src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/9349/alt-text-example.png"></p>
      <p>The keywords for alt text are "descriptive text". The alt text you write should provide the reader with enough information to have a good idea of what the image conveys. In this example, our current text of "My test image" is no good at all. A much better alternative for our Firefox logo would be "The Firefox logo: a flaming fox surrounding the Earth."</p>
